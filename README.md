# A-Real-Time-Gen-AI-Image-Colorization
 This project, developed during my internship at NullClass EdTech, explores advanced image colorization using deep learning. It features a GAN-based model for grayscale images, a cross-domain model for RGB, sketches, and infrared inputs, and a user-friendly interface. Data augmentation techniques , demonstrating enhanced image quality.
Overview
This repository showcases my internship projects at NullClass EdTech, focusing on advanced image colorization techniques using deep learning.

Projects
Basic Image Colorization: GAN-based model for colorizing grayscale images.
Cross-Domain Image Colorization: Models for handling RGB, sketches, and infrared inputs.
User Interface Development: Intuitive UI for user interaction with colorization models.
Key Features
Utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for high-quality image colorization.
Implements data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
Performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM) demonstrate significant improvements in image quality.
