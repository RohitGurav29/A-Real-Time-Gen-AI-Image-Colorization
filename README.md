# A-Real-Time-Gen-AI-Image-Colorization
 This project, developed during my internship at NullClass EdTech, explores advanced image colorization using deep learning. It features a GAN-based model for grayscale images, a cross-domain model for RGB, sketches, and infrared inputs, and a user-friendly interface. Data augmentation techniques , demonstrating enhanced image quality.
