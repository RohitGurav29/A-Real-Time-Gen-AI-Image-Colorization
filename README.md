# A-Real-Time-Gen-AI-Image-Colorization
 This project, developed during my internship at NullClass EdTech, explores advanced image colorization using deep learning. It features a GAN-based model for grayscale images, a cross-domain model for RGB, sketches, and infrared inputs, and a user-friendly interface. Data augmentation techniques , demonstrating enhanced image quality.
In this project, I focused on developing advanced image colorization techniques using deep learning, specifically leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The primary goal was to create models capable of automatically adding color to grayscale images, enhancing visual quality and realism. I began by implementing a basic GAN-based model that learned from diverse datasets, allowing the model to generate vivid colorizations based on patterns observed during training.

To improve the robustness of the colorization models, I explored data augmentation techniques. This involved applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to the training datasets. By artificially increasing the diversity of the training data, I aimed to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to generalize and perform well on unseen images. The results indicated significant improvements in image quality, as measured by performance metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

Recognizing the growing demand for versatile colorization solutions, I expanded the project to include cross-domain colorization capabilities. This involved developing models that could handle various input formats, such as sketches and infrared images, in addition to standard RGB images. I researched domain-specific techniques and integrated multiple datasets, ensuring that the models could effectively adapt to the unique challenges posed by each input type.

To facilitate user interaction with the colorization models, I designed an intuitive user interface. This interface allows users to select input domains and preview colorized outputs in real-time. By focusing on usability, I aimed to create a seamless experience for users, enabling them to engage with the technology easily and effectively.

Throughout the project, I maintained comprehensive documentation of methodologies, results, and reflections. This not only served as a record of my learning journey but also provided insights into the complexities of image processing and the practical applications of AI in various industries. The experience gained from this project has significantly enhanced my skills in deep learning, image processing, and software development.
